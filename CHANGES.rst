1.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- Now works on Windows (although it's not officially supported).
- Added --filter argument to unoconverter to allow explicit selection of which
  export filter to use for conversion.


1.2 (2022-03-17)
----------------

- Move logging configuration from import time to the main() functions.

- Improved the handling of KeyboardInterrupt

- Added the deprecated but still necessary com.sun.star.text.WebDocument
  for HTML docs.


1.1 (2021-10-14)
----------------

- Fixed a bug: If you specified an unknown file extension while piping the
  result to stdout, you would get a type error instead of the correct error.

- Added an extra check that libreoffice is quite dead when exiting,
  I experienced a few cases where soffice.bin was using 100% load in the
  background after unoserver exited. I hope this takes care of that.

- Added ``if __name__ == "main":`` blocks so you can run the modules
  as scripts, and also with ``python3 -m unoserver.server`` and
  ``python3 -m unoserver.converter``.
